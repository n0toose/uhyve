# Fixtures for filesystem-related tests

This directory, as well as this file, is a [test fixture][test-fixture].

It doesn't useful for Uhyve itself, but it is only really useful for tests.
Using this file, as well as other files in this directory, we can test
whether Uhyve's filesystem-related features actually work.

At the moment, these tests can be found in
[src/isolation.rs](src/isolation.rs).
